   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Data:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Readily Available image datasets
<p>
   </td>
   <td>There are multiple domain specific datasets (such as DIV2K for super resolution) that can be used. Combining datasets into one for training could also be an interesting challenge.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Engineering Challenge:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Real Time Processing
   </td>
   <td>I will try to stream the data in a bursty format so as to simulate a possible real world scenario, so that will be an interesting challenge.
